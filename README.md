# Team Project: TAship Management System

Project Description:

Research shows that teaching assistants (TAs) play a huge role in determining a studentâ€™s sense of belonging and their motivation to persist in the degree. The SMU CS department plans to develop a sustainable structure around how TAs are hired, trained, and evaluated.

This project is aimed at developing an internal web portal to support the TAship posting, application, selection, training, monitoring, and evaluation process in the SMU CS department. Currently, this process is conducted manually, and we aim to automate the workflow.


At a high level, the workflow contains three major steps:

  Department/Faculty publish open TA positions

  Full-time TA: 20 hours/week or Hourly TA (graduate/under): 5 ~ 20 hours/week

  Students submit TA applications

  Matchmaking (open-ended)
